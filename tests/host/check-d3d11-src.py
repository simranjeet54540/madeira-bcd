"""SwapDeviceContextState (tools/patch-dxmt-context-state-swap.py) and the
opt-in source build of DXMT's 64-bit d3d11.dll around it; no Wine runs.

Applies the patch to a copy of dxmt/src/d3d11 (or $DXMT_SRC/src/d3d11) through
its optional root argument and checks: IMPLEMENT_ME is gone from the method,
the one-time "[d3d11] madeira-bcd: SwapDeviceContextState in use" line is in,
a second run changes nothing, the submodule itself stays untouched. Then the
wiring: tools/build-d3d11-dll.sh patches a copy, compares its exports and
imported DLLs with the committed d3d11.dll, checks the marker and ships
d3d11-src.dll (never d3d11.dll); the workflow builds it before any DXMT patch
step without failing the run; WineProcessBridge.m links it in only for
env.MADEIRA_D3D11_SRC = 1; the catalog lists the switch, off by default.
