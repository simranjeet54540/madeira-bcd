# Build the ARM64EC FEX module (libarm64ecfex.dll) from the FEX submodule with
# tools/patch-fex-ios-mapview-selfshared.py and tools/patch-fex-ios-avx.py
# applied, and ship it as xtajit64.dll (and a copy as xtajit64-avx.dll, which
# WineProcessBridge.m links in when a game turns AVX on; the AVX patch is
# itself gated on MADEIRA_FEX_AVX=1). Since build 231 this replaces upstream's
# committed module: without the map-notification fix a thread that loads a
# DLL from translated code waits on itself (God of War).
#
# build/fex-arm64ec/build.sh does not record everything the committed DLL was
# built with; the options below reproduce it. FEX_IOS_HOST must reach the
# ASSEMBLER too: Module.S holds the iOS transition code (TEB from TPIDR, not
# x18; the FFS bypass). Builds 138-148 missed CMAKE_ASM_FLAGS, got the stock
# ExitToX64 (`str x30,[sp,#-8]!`, sp off 16-byte alignment) and every x64 DLL
# entry point crashed -- with section sizes identical, so sizes prove nothing.
# Before shipping, the unpatched source is built and compared with the
# committed DLL by function list and by the instructions of the Module.S
# transition code; any drift keeps the AVX build out. Run from the repo root.

# madeira-bcd: the patched module replaces upstream's xtajit64.dll.
#  - patch-fex-ios-mapview-selfshared.py: NotifyMapViewOfSection must not take
#    CodeInvalidationMutex exclusively on a thread that holds it shared (God of
#    War waited on itself inside LdrLoadDll, builds 226-230).
#  - patch-fex-ios-intervals-reentry.py: a memory notification raised by an
#    allocation made under InvalidationTracker's IntervalsLock (a log line
#    growing FEX's heap) must not wait on its own thread (God of War, builds
#    230-231: HandleMemoryProtectionNotification -> EFmt -> rpmalloc ->
#    VirtualAlloc -> NotifyMemoryAlloc -> the same lock).
#  - patch-fex-ios-ircap-tls.py: FEX's IR-capture mark was a thread_local that
#    landed in the game's own TLS[0] block and zeroed its bytes +0x8..+0xf on
#    every block compile (God of War's allocator-stack index, builds 234-238).
#  - patch-fex-ios-teb-tsd.py: the WinAPI shims' GetCurrentTEB() read x18,
#    which is 0 on some iOS threads (God of War's TlsGetValue AV, build 239);
#    they take the TEB from the TSD slot like Module.cpp's IOSLoadTEB.
#  - patch-fex-ios-cpuid-index.py: CPUID's brand-string/hybrid leaves index
#    the per-CPU table with the raw host CPU number (out of range on iOS).
#  - patch-fex-ios-alias-full-quiet.py: no LogMan call when the alias table is
#    full (it ran nested inside a unix syscall and corrupted its frame).
#  - patch-fex-ios-alias-retire-jit.py: a new image copy on a reused JIT range
#    retires the dead entry that still covers it (reverse translation walks
#    oldest-first and found the dead image).
#  - patch-fex-ios-avx.py: AVX/AVX2 only when MADEIRA_FEX_AVX=1 at launch, so
#    the same module serves both; xtajit64-avx.dll is kept as a copy for the
#    bridge's existing switch.
#  - patch-fex-ios-smc-store-fastpath.py: on the SMC path, plain stores and
#    stores already backpatched to DMB + STR are decided without the
#    backpatch lock (two Mach-emulated stores per fault) and without the
#    "Unhandled JIT SIGBUS" line; same Pc result. MADEIRA_FEX_SMC_FASTPATH=0
#    restores the locked path.
